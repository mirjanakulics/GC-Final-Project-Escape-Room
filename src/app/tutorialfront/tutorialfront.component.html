    <p>The insane surgeon, Dr. Lobotomy, has just escaped from jail. Known for performing unnecessary and inhumane
      operations on unwilling participants, he’s suspected to be lurking in your town. After staying late at the office
      one night, the last thing you remember is walking to your car in the dark. You just woke up here, strapped to a
      chair, and know you must be Dr. Lobotomy’s next victim. Use the items you find in the room to escape before he
      returns to finish his work!</p>
